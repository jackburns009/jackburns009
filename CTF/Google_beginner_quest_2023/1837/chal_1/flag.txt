flag{SOLDIERWEHAVEINTERCEPTEDTHEENE}

We start by examining the cipher text. Given that it has the same strange "â¸º" characters as the last cipher and that the hint references a confederate general we can assume that the cipher is another American style morse code cipher. After replacing the weird characters with the American morse code for L and decrypting the message using a translator such as the one found here: https://morsecode.world/american/translator.html we can see the following decoded message:

RETRIEVE USE A CODE WE GENERALS TRUE REST VERSION IT HAVE AMERICAN FLAG OF OF APPEARS INTERCEPTED TELEGRAPH SOLDIER ENEMY BE CIPHER TO BACON THE TO PEMBERTON MESSAGE {EOYFPIJPIYBGYNSVSDRPTMIYBJXSEC} ALLIES

We then see that the flag is still encrypted and is not in plaintext for us to view. Looking at the contents of the message we see that this is a "PEMBERTON MESSAGE" and from the hint we know that Pemberton is a general that used the vigenere cipher. Now examining the rest of the message we can see that the first few words are telling us to find a code that the generals used. After doing some research we find that there were 3 very popular codes that the confederates used.
Using the code "Manchester bluff we can decrypt the first have of the message to be:
SOLDIERWEHAVEINJSQPIPUPUKIMYZX

then using the code "complete victory" we get:
CAMQEEQLNQZNKWUTERCEPTEDTHEENE

putting the two decoded messages together we get the flag:
SOLDIERWEHAVEINTERCEPTEDTHEENE

We can assume that it is just cut off and that the real message is "soldier we hace intercepted the enemy"
