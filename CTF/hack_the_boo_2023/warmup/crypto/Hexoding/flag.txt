given the above string determining the flag was very easy. Given the name of the challenge it was easy to determine the first part to be hex. converting from hex to ascii you get:
HTB{kn0w1ng_h0w_t0_1d3nt1fy_3nc0d1ng_sch3m3s_1s_cruc14l_f0r_a_

and given the "=" at the end of the second part it is clear to see that part is base64 encoded so after decoding you get:
crypt0gr4ph3r___4ls0_d0_n0t_c0nfus3_enc0d1ng_w1th_encryp510n!}

putting the two parts together you get the whole flag.
HTB{kn0w1ng_h0w_t0_1d3nt1fy_3nc0d1ng_sch3m3s_1s_cruc14l_f0r_a_crypt0gr4ph3r___4ls0_d0_n0t_c0nfus3_enc0d1ng_w1th_encryp510n!}
